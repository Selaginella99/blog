	<h1 class="pageTitle">About me</h1>

  <p>Hi, I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the Biodemography of Aging Research Unit, Center for Population Health and Aging, Duke University. With more than six years' experience in genetics and epidemiology, I am interested in applying integrative genetic and environmental data analysis to understand aging and complex diseases.</p>

  <p>My current research project aims at improving our understanding of genetic mechanisms of human aging. I focus on the role of polygenic and pleiotropic genetic effects in determining the aging related phenotypes, and on the use of both hypothesis-free and candidate gene approaches.</p>
